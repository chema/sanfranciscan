post: Why the Riseup Collective's Canary Matters
---

After nearly five months, I am calling it: [Riseup's canary](https://riseup.net/en/canary) is truly well and dead. The Riseup Collective's services have been compromised and are no longer secure. This may sound like an farfetched claim, until you understand that the canary existed to let us know if this ever happened.

## Understanding Warrant Canaries

Whenever state authorities compel an internet service provider (ISP) to turn over user data, limits may also be placed on the target ISP on communicating the existence of said legal commands. Wary of this possibility, some ISPs use 'canary statements' (also called warrant canaries or transparency reports) to indirectly convey the integrity of their services to their users by taking advantage of the inability of state authorities to compel specific expressive statements.

## Riseup's Canary & Its Death

The Riseup Collective took their canary statement a step further by releasing a cryptographically-signed affirmative statement roughly every three months denying:

* Having received any National Security Letters or FISA court orders;
* Being subject to any gag order by a FISA court, or any other similar court of any government;
* Placing any backdoors in their hardware or software and having received any requests to do so;
* Disclosing any user communications to any third party.

The Riseup Collective took it one step further by using a cryptographically-signed statement that greatly diminished the possibility of state authorities updating the canary themselves in the case of the complete seizure of their infrastructure.

As of January 6, 2017, it has been 143 days—nearly five months—since the Riseup Collective's Canary was last updated. It is now prudent to assume some or all of the above denials are no longer valid and that the Riseup Collective's services have been compromised.

## Why Riseup's Compromise Matters Now More than Ever

The Riseup Collective [correctly states](https://riseup.net/en/about-us) that precise information can allow state authorities to disrupt large social movements through the disruption of specific relationships and associations. On January 20, the Trump administration will take control of the [United States Intelligence Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community), collectively the most powerful and experienced intelligence-gathering system in the history of the world.

Compromising one of the most visible and accessible community ISPs guarantees that movement organizations and individuals abandoning corporate communication infrastructure for community-created and community-led collectives remain vulnerable to state disruption.

## What Now?

We must find (or create!) alternative, secure ISPs that are invulnerable to or at least secure from known attacks. This is a list of suggestions that I will discuss in follow-up posts:

* **Email** [Protonmail](http://protonmail.com/), a Swiss-based provider. It isn't perfect, but it is legally and technologically safer than any US-based service, free or paid. *Accepts Bitcoin*
* **Hosting** [OrangeWebsite](http://orangewebsite.com/), an Iceland-based provider. Like Protonmail, it isn't perfect and should not be used for secure email, but it is legally and technologically safer than any US-based service. Their servers also run on 100% renewable energy.  *Accepts Bitcoin*
* **Text** For texting, use [Whisper System's](https://whispersystems.org/)'s Signal is great, particularly if you use disappearing messages.
* **Browsing** For everyday internet usage, use [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) and carefully stick to their suggestions.
* **Identity Control**. Can't beat [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/).
