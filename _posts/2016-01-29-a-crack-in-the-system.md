title: A Crack in the System 
---

After a couple of hours of getting acquainted with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and deploying it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I turned my attention to getting [Nassim](https://twitter.com/nassimsahar)'s new blog migrated to our host. It's called [A Crack in the System](http://crackinthesystem.org/) and focuses on issues I really care about, including animal liberation and food habits. She's in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas right now and will be using it to share her perspectives on what's going on down there. (*Hint:* It doesn't sound all that different from what going on here).
