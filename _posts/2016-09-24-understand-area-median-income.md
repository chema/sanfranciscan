post: Understand San Francisco's Area Media Income
---

It is almost impossible to participate in the San Francisco housing debate without hearing the acronym "AMI" at least a couple of times. AMI stands for Area Median Income and every year it is published by the Mayorâ€™s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD).

This number is important because it is used by MOHCD to establish the annual income limits and maximum rents for programs like the city-managed Below Market Rate housing program and by the broader community to determine how proposed and existing market-rate housing compares to affordable housing.

## Calculating the AMI

The MOHCD calculates the year's AMI chart using the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) "Unadjusted Area Median Income" for the HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area (HMFA) made up of San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo counties. HUD in turn calculates their number from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) data. MOHCD bases annual income limit chart on this number, using it as the basis for a 4-person household at 100% AMI.
