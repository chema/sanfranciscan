post: Understanding San Francisco's Area Media Income
---

It is almost impossible to participate in the San Francisco housing debate without hearing the acronym *AMI* at least a couple of times. AMI stands for *Area Median Income* and it is published annually by the [Mayorâ€™s Office of Housing and Community Development](http://sfmohcd.org/) (MOHCD).

### Calculating the AMI

MOHCD calculates the year's [AMI chart](http://sfmohcd.org/sites/default/files/Documents/MOH/2016_AMI_IncomeLimits-SanFranHMFA.pdf) using the U.S. [Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html) (HUD) *Unadjusted Area Median Income* for the HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area (HMFA) made up of San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo counties. HUD in turn calculates their number from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) data. Each year, MOHCD bases the annual income limit chart on this number, using it as the basis for a 4-person household at 100% AMI. 

#### Historical AMI numbers published by HUD

### Why is AMI important?

The AMI is important because it is used by MOHCD to establish annual income limits (and corresponding rents) for programs like the city-managed Inclusionary Housing BMR Rental Program. The AMI is also used by many community groups to determine how market-rate housing compares to affordable housing.

A question I will explore in a later post will be how does MOHCD's AMI compares to a more granular analysis of San Francisco household income, particularly when you consider strong income disparity that households of color experience.
