post: Understand San Francisco's Area Media Income
---

It is almost impossible to participate in the San Francisco housing debate without hearing the acronym **AMI** at least a couple of times. AMI stands for *Area Median Income* and it is published annually by the [Mayorâ€™s Office of Housing and Community Development](http://sfmohcd.org/) (MOHCD).

### Calculating the AMI

MOHCD calculates the year's AMI chart using the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html) (HUD) "Unadjusted Area Median Income" for the HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area (HMFA) made up of San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo counties. HUD in turn calculates their number from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) data. Each year, MOHCD bases the annual income limit chart on this number, using it as the basis for a 4-person household at 100% AMI. 

#### Historical AMI numbers published by HUD
Year | AMI | Year | AMI
---- | --- | ---- | ---
2016 | $107,700 | 2008 | $94,300
2015 | $101,900 | 2007 | $86,500
2014 | $97,100 | 2006 | $91,200
2013 | $101,200 | 2005 | $95,000
2012 | $103,000 | 2004 | $95,000
2011 | $101,600 | 2003 | $91,500
2010 | $99,400 | 2002 | $86,100
2009 | $96,800 | 2001 | $80,100

### Why is AMI important?

This number is important because it is used by MOHCD to establish the annual income limits and maximum rents for programs like the city-managed Below Market Rate housing program and by the broader community to determine how proposed and existing market-rate housing compares to affordable housing.

A question I will explore in later posts will be how does MOHCD's AMI compares to a more granular analysis of San Francisco household income, particularly when you consider strong income disparity that households of color experience.
