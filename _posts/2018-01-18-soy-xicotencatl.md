title: Soy Xicoténcatl
---

On March 17, 1755, the Indigenous people of San Francisco del Rincón, my family's town, liberated their town from Spanish colonialists. After three days, the insurgent Natives were defeated and taken captive by the colonial forces.

The following verses were written on a card taken from the defeated insurgents. An eagle was drawn on the card. Xicoténcatl was a Tlaxcallan general who fought and defeated the Spanish when they were on their way to [Mexihco Tenochtitlan](https://nah.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexihco_Tenochtitlan) in the early 1520s.

	de Tlaxcala general,
	y aunque agrio mi natural
	me convencí a la razón:
	con que logré galardón
	de acompañar a Cortés
	con mi ejército;
	y pues es mi nobleza tan notoria,
	sirva este triunfo de gloria
	y digna memoria de...
	_I am Xicoténcatl the Strong_
	_from Tlaxcala general,_
	_and though bitter my liegemen_
	_I convinced through reason:_
	_that reward was achieved_
	_to accompany Cortés_
	_with my army;_
	_and so is my nobility renown,_
	_may this glorious victory_
	_and deserving memory of..._
